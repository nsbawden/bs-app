## Constantine, Eusebius, and the Shaping of the Biblical Canon: Politics, Power, and Exclusion - d'Artagnan Ferrari

The formation of the biblical canon was not a purely spiritual endeavor; it was deeply entangled with political needs, theological disputes, and the consolidation of power within the early Christian church. At the heart of this process stood Emperor Constantine and his trusted advisor, Eusebius of Caesarea. While Constantine did not directly oversee the final canonization, his influence over Eusebius set in motion a process that shaped the selection and rejection of texts, culminating in the councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397), which formalized the biblical canon for the Latin-speaking Christian world.

### **Constantine and Eusebius: A Strategic Partnership**

Constantine the Great, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, was primarily concerned with unifying the fragmented Christian sects within his empire. Theological disputes had led to deep divisions, threatening the stability of both the church and the state. Eusebius of Caesarea, a church historian and biblical scholar, became one of Constantine’s closest allies in this effort. Eusebius had a reputation for theological flexibility and had been sympathetic to Arianism—a belief that Jesus was created by God and thus subordinate to Him, which was later deemed heretical.

Constantine’s interest in Christianity was largely political; he needed a unified church to reinforce the unity of his empire. His involvement in the First Council of Nicaea in 325 was primarily aimed at settling the Arian controversy, but in doing so, he laid the groundwork for determining which texts would be considered authoritative. Though Nicaea did not formally decide the biblical canon, it strengthened the position of Eusebius, who had already been compiling lists of acceptable scriptures.

### **Eusebius' Categorization and Its Consequences**

Eusebius divided Christian writings into four categories:
1. **Accepted texts** – These included the Gospels, Acts, and Pauline Epistles, which were widely used in churches.
2. **Disputed texts** – Some books, such as James, 2 Peter, and Revelation, were in use but not universally accepted.
3. **Spurious texts** – These were writings considered questionable or of dubious origin.
4. **Heretical texts** – Books associated with Gnostic and other sects, such as the Gospel of Thomas, were outright rejected.

Though Eusebius’ list was not the final word on canonization, it greatly influenced the councils that followed. His bias in favor of texts that aligned with emerging orthodoxy—backed by Constantine’s political interests—helped exclude alternative Christian voices, particularly those with Gnostic or non-Trinitarian views.

### **The Role of the Councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397)**

By the late 4th century, Christianity had become the official religion of the Roman Empire under Emperor Theodosius I. The need for a definitive canon became pressing, and the Councils of Hippo and Carthage took up the task of finalizing the list of sacred texts.

These councils were attended by prominent church figures, including **Augustine of Hippo**, who played a major role in affirming the canon. Augustine viewed scripture as essential for defending orthodox Christianity against heresies such as Donatism and Pelagianism. **Bishop Aurelius of Carthage** presided over the Council of Carthage, reinforcing decisions made at Hippo. These men, along with others, were deeply involved in consolidating a version of Christianity that aligned with Roman authority.

Many of the figures present at these councils had been influenced by earlier decisions—directly or indirectly shaped by Eusebius and the political needs of Constantine’s era. By affirming the 27 books of the New Testament and rejecting others, they ensured a doctrinal consistency that would define the church for over a thousand years.

### **The Suppression of Alternative Texts**

The Gnostic Gospels and other early Christian writings offered diverse theological perspectives, many of which were excluded due to their incompatibility with the church-state model of unity. Texts such as the Gospel of Mary, the Gospel of Judas, and the Acts of Thomas contained ideas that were seen as too radical or subversive. Their exclusion was not purely theological but also political—Constantine’s vision of a single, unified church could not tolerate theological pluralism.

### **Conclusion**

The canonization of the Bible was a process deeply influenced by power, politics, and the need for unity within the Roman Empire. Constantine’s influence, through his relationship with Eusebius, helped shape the framework that later councils used to determine which texts would define Christian doctrine. The Councils of Hippo and Carthage, composed of influential bishops like Augustine, formalized decisions that had been years in the making. As a result, the biblical canon became not just a collection of sacred writings but a carefully curated tool for establishing orthodoxy and suppressing dissent.

Understanding this history provides insight into how religious authority was constructed and why certain voices were silenced—decisions that continue to shape Christian thought to this day.
