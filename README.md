# Bible Study Browser App

A web-based application for exploring and studying the Bible and related texts, built collaboratively with Grok 3 by xAI.

**Repository**: [https://github.com/nsbawden/bs-app](https://github.com/nsbawden/bs-app)  
**Raw Base URL**: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsbawden/bs-app/main/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsbawden/bs-app/main/)

**Note for Collaboration**: This document serves dual purposes: it describes the app for human users and provides a comprehensive starting point for future work sessions with Grok 3. Hand this README to Grok 3 to resume development seamlessly.

## Project Goals
- Deliver an intuitive, feature-rich tool for casual readers and serious scholars of the Bible and apocryphal texts like 1 Enoch.
- Operate as a web app with a clean, accessible interface, with potential for future mobile expansion.

## Key Features
- **Navigation**: Browse books, chapters, and verses via dropdown selectors or "Next/Previous Chapter/Book" buttons, with state (last viewed location) persisted in `localStorage`. Now includes 1 Enoch alongside canonical Bible books.
- **Bible Versions**: Switch between translations (WEB, KJV, ASV, BBE, DRA, YLT) via a selector, with 1 Enoch available in R.H. Charles‚Äôs 1917 translation. Plans to add ESV support.
- **Verse Interaction**: Click any verse to highlight it and update the current location.
- **Notes**: Click a verse number to add/edit a note in a hovering popup. Notes saved in `localStorage` under `bibleNotes` as a JSON object, indexed by `book/chapter/verse` (e.g., `Genesis/1/1`). Verses with notes show a blue number (`#1997FB`), underlined text, and a notepad icon (`üìù`) with "Add note" tooltip on hover for noted verses, or just "Add note" for others.
- **AI Assistance**: Query an integrated OpenAI API (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) about the selected verse, with responses rendered in Markdown and an expand/collapse toggle. Supports manual fallback (copy to clipboard, paste from external AI).
- **Settings**: Customize AI behavior via a top-bar gear button popup, controlling:
  - **Max AI History Length**: Limits stored question/answer pairs (default: 10).
  - **Temperature**: Adjusts response creativity (0-2).
  - **OpenAI Model**: Selects model (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`).
  - **Max Tokens**: Sets output length limit (50-4096).
- **Responsive UI**: Dark background (`#1A1A1A`) with light text (`#F0F0F0`) and green accents (`#4A704A`) for interactive elements, optimized for readability.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla, with `marked.js` for Markdown rendering).
- **Data**: Bible-API.com for canonical verse text, `1enoch.json` (local file) for 1 Enoch, OpenAI API for AI queries, `localStorage` for state, settings, and notes persistence.
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub for version control, local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for development.

## File Structure
- **`index.html`**: Primary app HTML.
- **`apikey.html`**: Help screen for creating API Key.
- **`styles.css`**: App HTML styles, including note popup and tooltip styles.
- **`config.js`**: Centralized defaults, state management, constants (e.g., `books`, `bookOrder`), and notes management functions (`getNotes`, `saveNote`, `deleteNote`).
- **`ui.js`**: DOM elements, event listeners, settings popup, and note popup logic (`showNotePopup`).
- **`bible.js`**: Bible and 1 Enoch navigation, verse fetching, and display rendering with note styling.
- **`ai.js`**: OpenAI integration, AI query handling, and token usage tracking.
- **`1enoch.json`**: Full text of 1 Enoch (108 chapters) in JSON format, based on R.H. Charles‚Äôs 1917 translation.

## Progress Log
- **2025-02-22**: Initial setup with navigation, version switching, and manual AI query system.
- **2025-02-23**: Major updates:
  - Refactored single `script.js` into four files (`config.js`, `ui.js`, `bible.js`, `ai.js`) for modularity.
  - Integrated OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo` initially, now defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`) with dynamic cost tracking.
  - Added settings popup in top bar (gear button) for `maxHistoryLength`, `temperature`, `model`, and `maxTokens`.
  - Centralized defaults in `config.js`, removing redundancy.
  - Optimized top bar layout: select boxes grouped left, gear button right, all on one line.
- **2025-02-24**: Updates in this session:
  - Added note-taking: Users can click verse numbers to add/edit notes in a popup, stored in `localStorage` as `bibleNotes`. Verses with notes styled with blue numbers (`#1997FB`), underlined text, and a notepad icon (`üìù`) with "Add note" tooltip on hover (via `.has-note` class); verses without notes show "Add note" on hover.
  - Integrated 1 Enoch: Added `1enoch.json` (108 chapters, R.H. Charles‚Äôs 1917 translation) to the app, accessible via navigation. Updated `fetchChapter` in `bible.js` to fetch from `/1enoch.json` for "1 Enoch", with `bookOrder` and `books` in `config.js` expanded to include it (108 chapters).
  - Enhanced UI: Added CSS for note popups and tooltips in `styles.css`, ensuring visual consistency.

## Future Goals
- Add ESV support via API with section headings.
- Enhance AI prompts for richer responses (e.g., custom system messages via settings).
- Expand study tools (highlights persistence, cross-references).
- Integrate multimedia (audio readings, images).
- Optimize `1enoch.json` loading (e.g., lazy loading or splitting into smaller files).

### Notes on Changes
- **Notes Feature**: Added under "Key Features" with details on functionality, styling, and storage. Updated `config.js`, `ui.js`, `bible.js`, and `styles.css` in "File Structure" to reflect their roles.
- **1 Enoch Integration**: Expanded "Project Goals," "Key Features," "Tech Stack," and "File Structure" to include 1 Enoch. Noted its addition in navigation, data sourcing (`1enoch.json`), and local server requirement in "Workflow Notes."
- **Progress Log**: Added a detailed entry for February 24, 2025, summarizing note-taking and 1 Enoch integration.
