        <h1>Guide to Obtaining and Using Your OpenAI API Key</h1>
        <p>The Bible Study Browser App uses OpenAI's powerful AI models to provide insightful explanations of Bible
            verses. With your API Key, you can ask the AI to explain selected verses, enhancing your study experience.
            This guide will walk you through obtaining your key, setting up payment, and adding it to the app.</p>

        <h2>Obtaining Your OpenAI API Key</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Visit <a href="https://platform.openai.com">OpenAI's platform</a> and sign up or log in.</li>
            <li>Once logged in, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select "View API keys".</li>
            <li>Click "Create new secret key" and give it a name (e.g., "Bible Study App Key").</li>
            <li>Copy the key and save it securely. You won't be able to view it again after closing the window.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Setting Up Payment and Understanding Costs</h2>
        <p>OpenAI requires a payment method for API usage. Here's what you need to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must add a payment method to your OpenAI account for the API Key to work.</li>
            <li>The minimum credit purchase is $5, which is added to your account balance.</li>
            <li>Costs are based on token usage and vary by the selected model. For example, with gpt-4o-mini (the
                default model), a typical verse explanation might cost less than $0.01, allowing for hundreds of queries
                with the minimum $5 credit. Note that selecting a more advanced model like gpt-4o will consume credits
                faster.</li>
            <li>You can set usage limits in your OpenAI account to control spending.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more details on pricing, visit <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing">OpenAI's pricing page</a>.</p>

        <h2>Adding Your API Key to the App</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Bible Study Browser App.</li>
            <li>Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top bar to open settings.</li>
            <li>Find the "OpenAI API Key" field and paste your key.</li>
            <li>Click "Save" to store your key.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your key will be saved in the app's local storage and used for AI queries.</p>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your API Key secure and do not share it with others. The app stores your API Key in your browser's
                local storage. Ensure your device is secure to protect your key.</li>
            <li>If you suspect your key has been compromised, you can revoke it from OpenAI's platform and generate a
                new one.</li>
            <li>You can manage your API Keys and usage through OpenAI's platform.</li>
            <li>If you encounter errors with the API Key, ensure it's correctly entered in the app's settings and that
                your OpenAI account has sufficient credits.</li>
        </ul>
