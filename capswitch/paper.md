**Title:** Charge Conservation and Energy Amplification in Capacitive Voltage Multipliers

**Author:** [Your Name]

**Abstract:**
This paper explores the theoretical and experimental behavior of a Cockcroft-Walton-style capacitive voltage multiplier circuit driven by an H-bridge square wave from a DC source. Unlike conventional treatments where conservation of energy is assumed to be paramount, this work presents the hypothesis that charge conservation has priority over energy conservation in such systems. The mathematical model and physical circuit both show a persistent anomaly: the total energy stored in the capacitors can exceed the energy input from the battery by a factor of 2 or more, depending on the number of stages. All capacitors (except the input capacitor) reach the same voltage, but the total stack voltage increases with each stage. We present empirical data, mathematical modeling, and theoretical implications, suggesting that energy is a derived concept contingent on context, while charge remains a fundamental conserved quantity.

**1. Introduction**
Conservation of energy is considered one of the foundational principles of physics. However, this principle relies on various assumptions, particularly in the context of electrical circuits where voltages and currents are interpreted as proxies for energy transfer. Charge conservation, by contrast, is absolute and universally conserved across all physical processes.

This study examines a Cockcroft-Walton-style voltage multiplier circuit driven by a square wave from a battery-powered H-bridge. The model simulates and calculates both charge movement and energy changes across the system, revealing a discrepancy in energy conservation. The findings suggest that, in this specific circuit configuration, the energy stored in the capacitor ladder can greatly exceed the energy input from the battery, while charge is conserved throughout.

**2. Circuit Description**
The circuit consists of a symmetrical Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier composed solely of diodes and capacitors. The input is a pulsed DC voltage from an H-bridge, toggling polarity to effectively pump charge through the diode ladder.

No coils, inductors, or magnetic fields are involved—only capacitors and diodes. Therefore, there is no potential for inductive energy contributions, eliminating typical explanations for apparent energy gain such as back EMF or magnetic field collapse.

All capacitors in the ladder (except the single input capacitor) charge to the same voltage level after a sufficient number of pulses. The total voltage of the stacked capacitors increases linearly with the number of stages. The input capacitor reaches only half the voltage of the other capacitors.

**3. Model Description**
The simulation models the progressive charge and voltage development across each stage of the multiplier. Pulse duration is long enough to allow capacitors to reach full charge, ensuring measurements reflect steady-state behavior.

Charge is tracked across all stages. The total charge delivered by the battery is equal to the total charge stored in the ladder. The energy stored in the ladder is calculated using two methods: the conventional formula \( E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \), and \( E = \frac{Q^2}{2C} \). These give consistent results within the model.

As the number of stages increases, the total energy stored in the ladder increases disproportionately. With 4 stages, the energy gain is about 1.92×, but simulations show that with 20 stages, the gain approaches 9.8×, with energy increasing due to the stacking of charge at progressively higher potentials.

To estimate the battery's contribution per pulse, the model uses a decaying exponential factor for each pulse based on a time constant \( \tau \) set to 1/5 the number of total pulses, which simulates the natural leveling off of charge delivery as the system saturates. The "portion per pulse" constant used in this computation was derived empirically and found to be approximately 0.618—the reciprocal of the Golden Ratio (\( \Phi \)). This value corresponds closely to the effective portion of a full charge cycle that contributes to useful energy transfer in the circuit, factoring in the dynamics of both input capacitor charge and leakage during switching.

Interestingly, 0.618 emerges as an experimentally matched fit to the simulated behavior of charge delivery in the circuit. A full 0.5 portion would theoretically make sense, since only one half-cycle allows input capacitor charging, but additional discharge activity during the opposite half-cycle—where some charge continues to move through the multiplier—suggests a subtle, persistent bias. This extra leakage appears to elevate the actual effective charge contribution, producing the match with the Phi-derived 0.618.

**4. Experimental Results**
The following parameters were used:

```json
{
  "batteryVoltage": 12,
  "inputResistance": 50,
  "numPulses": 60,
  "cycleDuration": 0.5,
  "inputCapacitor": 0.001,
  "numStages": 4,
  "outResistance": 100
}
```

Outputs:
```json
{
  "actualInputVoltage": 11.52,
  "batteryTotalCharge": 0.08639,
  "batteryTotalEnergy": 1.037,
  "capFinalVoltage": 46.08,
  "capTotalCharge": 0.08639,
  "capTotalEnergy": 1.99,
  "energyRatio": 1.92
}
```

Capacitor voltages were measured directly and confirmed the model prediction: all capacitors (except the input capacitor) reach 11.52V (with a 12V battery input), and the input capacitor reaches approximately 5.76V.

**5. Discussion**
The simulation and physical experiments both show:
- Charge is conserved throughout the circuit.
- Energy appears to increase, with output energy significantly exceeding input energy.

The increase in total energy occurs despite the effective stacked capacitance being lower (due to the series arrangement). The key finding is that all capacitors (except the input) charge to the same voltage, but because they are stacked in series, the total potential difference increases with each added stage. This results in a higher voltage across a lower effective capacitance, which still produces more energy.

This challenges the classical notion of energy conservation in systems governed purely by capacitive charge movement. Unlike resistive or inductive systems, there is no mechanism for energy to be stored or hidden. Energy is calculated solely based on charge and voltage, and the data suggest a net gain.

The total system charge is calculated globally by computing the sum of all charge on each capacitor based on their voltages. This allows direct tracking of charge conservation, irrespective of local voltage conditions or energy accounting. In the implementation, the function `VMTS_simulateCircuit` uses `capTotalCharge1x` as the master value, combining voltage and capacitor count to determine conserved system charge. Energy is then derived from this charge, either using the series voltage or recomputing through series capacitance.

**6. Implications and Hypothesis**
We propose that energy is not fundamental, but a contextual construct dependent on how charge interacts with potential. In conventional systems, charge and energy move in lockstep, reinforcing the belief in energy conservation. But in purely capacitive systems with diode directionality and waveform-driven charge movement, this assumption may break down.

If charge is conserved and energy is not, this invites new perspectives on circuit behavior, especially in switched or ladder-based topologies. It also opens speculation on systems that could "bootstrap" or self-operate under controlled conditions, provided losses are lower than the energy gain factor.

**7. Conclusion**
This study models and experimentally verifies that a diode-capacitor voltage multiplier can preserve charge while appearing to violate energy conservation. This behavior persists in simulation and measurement. We suggest that charge conservation is more fundamental, and that in certain circuit topologies, energy calculations based on voltage and current can misrepresent physical processes. Instead, energy calculations based on charge \( (E = Q^2 / 2C) \) more faithfully track actual energy flow. The effect becomes more pronounced with increased stage count, reaching 9.8× with 20 stages and even higher as the stages further increase.
