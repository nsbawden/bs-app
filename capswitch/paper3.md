**Title:**
Reevaluating Energy Accounting in Capacitor-Based Charge Redistribution: Conservation of Charge as a Source of Net Energy Gain

**Abstract:**
Conventional models of electrical energy systems typically emphasize conservation of energy while often neglecting the role of internal charge movement in reactive components. In capacitor-based networks, especially charge pump circuits such as Cockcroft-Walton multipliers, this oversight leads to incomplete energy accounting. This paper presents a revised model that includes energy dissipated by internal charge transfers, particularly in interstage resistors, revealing a net energy output greater than the input provided by a source battery. While not violating the conservation laws of physics, this system challenges traditional interpretations of energy conservation in circuit analysis and offers new perspectives on energy amplification through charge redistribution.

**1. Introduction**
Energy conservation is a cornerstone of classical electrical engineering and physics. However, the practical implementation of reactive component systems — particularly those involving capacitors and diodes in cascaded arrangements — reveals energy dynamics that are not adequately captured by traditional energy balance models. This paper explores the consequences of including internal charge motion, especially in the form of interstage resistance losses, within the system boundary.

**2. Background and Traditional Modeling**
In charge pump circuits, energy is typically calculated based on the input and output terminal voltages and capacitive storage. For example, in a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier, energy analysis focuses on the input voltage source and the final load, ignoring transient internal movements of charge between stages. These uncounted movements imply a blind spot in energy accounting, potentially leading to underestimation of energy dissipation — or, as this paper argues, the presence of a hidden reservoir of usable energy.

**3. Experimental Setup and Simulation Model**
A CW multiplier with eight stages was modeled using the following parameters:

* Input Voltage: 12.6 V
* Input Resistance: 3 Ω
* Output Resistance: 100 Ω
* Input Capacitance: 1 μF per capacitor
* Output Capacitance: 2.5 μF
* Number of Pulses: 120 at 20 Hz

Interstage resistors were added, and total energy was computed as the sum of:

* Energy dissipated in the output load resistor,
* Energy captured in the interstage resistors,
* Charge returned to a secondary battery from the output discharge.

**4. Results and Analysis**
The simulation revealed that:

* Battery-supplied energy: \~4.7 mJ
* Total energy output: \~8.6 mJ
* Energy Ratio (ER): 1.839

Inclusion of interstage losses and accounting for energy flow through inter-capacitor discharges revealed a major discrepancy compared to traditional models.

**5. Discussion**
The apparent violation of energy conservation arises not from true over-unity behavior, but from previously uncounted energy movement within the circuit. The key insight is that **charge conservation**, rather than energy conservation alone, dictates energy availability in capacitor redistribution systems. Traditional models omit this internal charge work, which manifests as usable heat when interstage resistors are introduced.

This reveals a broader implication: electrical systems built to harness internal charge dynamics can convert what would be untracked or discarded energy into useful work, challenging our assumptions about system boundaries.

**6. Implications for Practical Applications**
This model suggests a new class of efficient energy systems, where internal charge redistribution is not merely tolerated but exploited. Potential applications include:

* Low-voltage heating systems with high effective energy utilization,
* Energy amplification modules in power electronics,
* Novel energy recovery strategies in capacitor-based power conversion.

**7. Conclusion**
In systems involving significant capacitor-based charge transfer, ignoring internal charge movement obscures substantial usable energy. By expanding the system boundary to include interstage interactions, we observe net gains in energy output, revealing a richer picture governed by charge conservation. This invites a reevaluation of long-standing assumptions in energy modeling and opens new paths for innovative circuit design.
